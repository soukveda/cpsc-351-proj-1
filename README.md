Programming language used: 
- C++


How to execute the program:
- navigate to your working directory in the terminal
- type "make" into the terminal to compile both the receiver and sender programs
- open another terminal in the same directory (you should have two terminals running)
- type "./recv" in one terminal
- type "./sender 'keyfile.txt' in the other

# The rest is still a work in progress
- press "crt+c" in the terminal with the receiver process to terminate

Is the extra credit implemented? ->
