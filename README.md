First programming assignment for CPSC 351-02:

Christopher Phongsa   -   cphongsa@csu.fullerton.edu

Jared Castaneda       -   jaredcast97@gmail.com

Juan Toledo           -   toledojuan73@gmail.com

Programming language used: 
- C++


How to execute the program:
- Make sure you are running in a Linux environment
- navigate to your working directory in the terminal
- type "make" into the terminal to compile both the receiver and sender programs
- open another terminal in the same directory (you should have two terminals running)
- type "./recv" in one terminal
- type "./sender 'keyfile.txt' in the other


- press "crt" +" c" in the terminal with the receiver process to deallocate memory, the message queue, and then exits.
